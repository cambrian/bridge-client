# bridge-client
A TypeScript module for interfacing with our Haskell-based backend.

## Installation
```bash
npm install https://github.com/1protocol/bridge-client#7199f00 --save
```
This version is tied to a [particular](https://github.com/1protocol/vest-hs/tree/a88a6ed70582ddd3844aa07c7b8827151bf082a3)
Manager commit, which will enable you to complete the following demo.

## Demo
The Manager [executable](https://github.com/1protocol/vest-hs/releases/tag/v0.1-dummy-manager) must
be running in its own shell. If you want to try out `bridge-client` but do not already have a
TypeScript project, see the next section for a toy setup.
```typescript
// This file is also in test/example.ts.
import * as WebSocket from 'ws'

import { BridgeClient, Call, Server, observe } from '@src'

async function makeSocket (): Promise<WebSocket> {
  return new Promise<WebSocket>((resolve, _) => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:3000')
    ws.on('open', () => resolve(ws))
  })
}

async function run (): Promise<void> {
  const ws = await makeSocket()
  const client = BridgeClient.make<Server.DummyManager>(ws)

  // Second parameter is your desired timeout.
  // AddInts and EchoThrice have a built-in 250 ms server-side delay.
  const result = await Call.DummyManager.addInts(client, undefined, { a: 3, b: 4 })
  console.log(result) // Output: 7

  try {
    const result = await Call.DummyManager.addInts(client, 100, { a: 3, b: 4 })
    console.log(result)
  } catch (exception) {
    console.log(exception.message) // Output: request timed out (100)
  }

  const stream = await Call.DummyManager.echoThrice(client, undefined, 1337)
  await observe(console.log, stream) // Output: 1337 (x3)

  try {
    const stream = await Call.DummyManager.echoThrice(client, 100, 1337)
    await observe(console.log, stream)
  } catch (exception) {
    console.log(exception.message) // Output: request timed out (100)
  }

  const fizzBuzz = { a: 'Fizz', b: 'Buzz' }
  const result2 = await Call.DummyManager.concatTextAuth(client, undefined, 'Token', fizzBuzz)
  console.log(result2) // Output: { result: 'FizzBuzz' }

  const stream2 = await Call.DummyManager.echoThriceAuth(client, undefined, 'Token', '1337')
  await observe(console.log, stream2) // Output: '1337' (x3)
  ws.close()
}

run()
```
Usage Note: Users are responsible for opening a WebSocket connection and passing a
WebSocket-compatible object to `BridgeClient.make`. Consider using a reconnecting WebSocket
implementation, such as [this](https://github.com/pladaria/reconnecting-websocket) repo.

## Toy Setup
Run the Manager executable as before. Then open a separate shell and run these commands, which will
populate a new subdirectory `bridge-test` (if this fails to create a `node_modules` folder, ensure
that parent directories do not contain such a folder):
```bash
mkdir -p bridge-test
cd bridge-test
# You must have NPM installed at the very least...
npm install ws @types/ws https://github.com/1protocol/bridge-client#7199f00 typescript node
```
Copy the code from the previous section into a file `bridge-test/main.ts`. Then (from the
`bridge-test` subdirectory):
```
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --lib 'es2018' main.ts
./node_modules/.bin/node main.js
```
And you should see the desired output.

## Concept
Our back-end codebase relies on Haskell's type safety to prevent errors of all kinds. Naturally, we
want our front-end RPC callers to use the same types as our back-end RPC handlers. Since we're using
a different language (TypeScript) to build out the front-end, however, and since all data is
text-serialized when it goes over the network, we can't just copy our request and response types
from back-end to front-end.

Fortunately, Haskell magic lets us generate RPC functions and types for the TypeScript front-end to
use. This requires only some up-front work to create the right boilerplate. Now whenever the
back-end API changes, our RPC functions can be automatically re-generated from templatesâ€”with no
room for manual translation errors.

In more concrete terms, let's say that the back-end had the following API:
- Route `foo` from a `FooRequest` to a single `FooResponse`.
- Route `bar` from a `BarRequest` to a single `BarResponse`.
- Route `baz` from a `BazRequest` to streaming `BazResponse`.

After we generate this module, it will contain these three functions (roughly):
- `foo (webSocket: WebSocket, request: FooRequest): Promise<FooResponse>`
- `bar (webSocket: WebSocket, request: BarRequest): Promise<BarResponse>`
- `baz (webSocket: WebSocket, request: BazRequest): Stream<BazResponse>`

This module exports a namespace `Call` with our actual generated functions.
